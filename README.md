# Lita_Project_Salesdata
This is where the project given at the end of the data analysis training is documented.

### Project Overview
This project is to demonstrate the workflow for analyzing a dataset that contains sales data of a retail store using Microsoft Excel, SQL Server and PowerBi. The goal of the project is to showcase how the data can be transformed, analyzed, and visualized to generate actionable insight and to produce an interactive PowerBi dashboard for reporting and decision making. The sales performance was analyzed to know the top-selling products, regional performance, monthly sales and many more.

### Data Source
The sales data of the retail store was provided by the facilitators for the final project of the training. The dataset contains the orderid, customerid, product, region, quantity, order date and unit price.

### Tools and Techniques
- Microsoft Excel: This was used for the initial data cleaning, calculation of metrics such as average sales and total revenue.and creation of pivot tables to summarise the data.
- SQL Server: This was used for querying and manipulating the dataset. It was used to extract insights such as top-selling product, revenue per region and many more.
- Power BI: This wass used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that provide a summary of the data analysis results.

### Steps Taken
